## Markov Chain Sentence Generator

A first iteration of a relatively simple program that generetes random text by using Markov Chain. So far the program uses multiple books to generate text.
Also as a warning, all the given books that I use in this project are in public domain, so there is no need to worry about copyrtight.

So far I also plan to:
- [x] Add multiple books to generation
- [x] Add other authors for generation (probably Lovecraft and some others)
- [ ] Optimize the code
