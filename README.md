## Markov Chain Sentence Generator

A first iteration of a relatively simple program that generetes random text by using Markov Chain. So far the program only uses 1 book by Robert E. Howard (Hour of Dragon) to generate the text.

So far I also plan to:
- [ ] Add multiple books to generation
- [ ] Add other authors for generation (probably Lovecraft and some others)
- [ ] Optimize the code
